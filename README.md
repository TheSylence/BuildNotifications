### Group
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/rgNxwP8.gif "Group by whatever you want")
Group with up to 4 levels deep. By source/defintion/branch to exactly suit your needs.

### React
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/h8Gbj7M.gif "Highlight failed builds")
Sort your builds by status ascending, descending or by name. Immedietaly see and react when a specific branch/definition/project is not building and minimize failures. Use powerful settings to specify exactly for what you want to be notified for.

### Customize
![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/oXAbwIr.gif "Customize your experience to cater your needs")
Write or use plugins for whatever platform you use. GitHub for sources, Jenkins for builds? Azure DevOps for both? Something completely different? It's all possible and configurable. Want to be notified for only certain branches? Only when manually built? Prefer dark mode?
